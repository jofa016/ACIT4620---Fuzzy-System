# Fuzzy Demand Classification & Scheduling
## **Problem statement:** How can household energy consumption be classified into low, medium, and high demand levels to enable cost optimization?

> **Goal:** How can household energy consumption patterns be classified into Low, Medium, and High demand levels in a way that reflects both temporal usage variations and dynamic electricity pricing, so that fuzzy logic–based scheduling can enable cost optimization and reduce peak demand?
